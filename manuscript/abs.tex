This study has identified flexible, general, and performant algorithms
available for application to simulating demand-driven deployment of nuclear
fuel cycle facility capacity in a fuel cycle simulator. Accordingly, a review
of current \gls{NFC} simulation tools was conducted to determine their current
capabilities for demand-driven and transition scenarios.  Additionally, the
authors investigated promising algorithmic innovations that have been
successful for similar applications in other domains such as economics and
industrial engineering Finally, the applicability of such algorithms in the
context of challenging nuclear fuel cycle simulation questions has been
described.
