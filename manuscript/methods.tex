\section{Methods}
At a high level, a meta-review of previous \gls{NFC} gap analyses 
helped to identify the existing simulators and their high 
level capabilities. The strongest comparison of transition scenario code 
capabilities is found in \cite{boucher_international_2010}, 
\cite{brown_identification_2016} and \cite{mccarthy_benchmark_2012}, in which 
international \gls{NFC} simulators to conduct specific transition scenarios 
were tested through systematic benchmarks. In 
\cite{carre_overview_2009} and \cite{hoffman_expanded_2016}, the ability of individual 
simulators to conduct transition scenarios is addressed, however the 
flexibility and performance of their varying algorithms for this capability are 
not addressed.

Primary references for an array of fuel cycle simulators were consulted to 
determine the facility deployment logic present in other existing
\gls{NFC} simulators. Where the details of dynamic demand driven 
simulation were unknown, this review individually investigated avilable tools.
