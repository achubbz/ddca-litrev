        The review concludes that fuel cycle simulation tools approach scenario objective functions in 
        various ways.  Some wrap realizations of the simulator in an external 
        optimizer, while others employ look-ahead methods to predict malformed 
        simulation inputs.  These methods fail to realistically model the 
        process by which utilities, governments, and other stakeholders 
        actually make facility deployment decisions.  

        Dynamic, demand-driven facility deployment may be enabled by algorithms 
        in use in other fields.  Deployment models were categorized into into 
        three categories: non optimizing (NO), deterministic-optimizing (DO), 
        and stochastic-optimizing (SO). Among these, it characterizes 
        performance (in terms of both compute speed and human effort), 
        flexibility (in terms of the range of scenarios capably simulated), and 
        robustness (in terms of consistent fidelity of the modeling results).  
        
        In conclusion, current NFC simulators may more flexibly support 
        demand-driven deployment through incorporation of non-optimizing 
        algorithms such as \gls{ARMA} \cite{woodard_stationarity_2011} and 
        \gls{ARCH} \cite{li_kernel_2016}, deterministically optimizing methods 
        such as those collected in \gls{GCAM} \cite{edmonds_advanced_1994} and 
        \gls{MARKAL} \cite{fishbone_markal_1981}, or stochastic optimization 
        techniques such as Markov Switching Models 
        \cite{ansari_predicting_2015}.
