        The review concludes that fuel cycle simulation tools approach scenario objective functions in 
        various ways.  Some wrap realizations of the simulator in an external 
        optimizer, while others employ look-ahead methods to predict malformed 
        simulation inputs.  These methods fail to realistically model the 
        process by which utilities, governments, and other stakeholders 
        actually make facility deployment decisions. Dynamic, demand-driven 
        facility deployment may be enabled by non-optimizing algorithms such as 
        \gls{ARMA} \cite{woodard_stationarity_2011} and \gls{ARCH} 
        \cite{li_kernel_2016}, deterministically 
        optimizing methods such as those collected in \gls{GCAM} 
        \cite{edmonds_advanced_1994} and \gls{MARKAL} 
        \cite{fishbone_markal_1981}, or stochastic optimization 
        techniques such as Markov Switching Models \cite{ansari_predicting_2015}.
